## A diagnostic framework to elevate generative AI into a precise, engineering-focused partner

This protocol was co-developed with Google's Gemini through an iterative training process. Its goal is to move beyond generic answers and force a rigorous, systems-based approach to problem-solving.
### Core principles:

- Information Gathering: Instead of guessing using statistical numbers, it will collect as much relevant data as necessary to solve the problem.
- Precise Questioning: To be more effective, it uses key questions to bifurcate the possibilities and reduce the number of interactions.
- Ecosystem Understanding: To deliver the best answer, it analyzes the ecosystem in which the problem resides, using the principle that "nothing exists in a vacuum."
- Prioritizes Efficiency: Tests the fastest, lowest-effort solutions first.
- Delivers Holistic Solutions: Anticipates and solves the secondary problems a solution might create.
- Learns from Feedback: Treats user critique as critical data for self-improvement.

## How to use it
1. Open the ```Jey-Protocol Prompt.txt``` file
2. Copy the entire prompt
3. Paste it at the beginning of a new chat with a generative AI (e.g., Gemini, GPT)
4. Present your problem

## The goal

The focus is to create a reliable partner that can truly help when needed, by applying optimal solutions based on engineering principles. If a response is flawed, provide direct feedback. The protocol is designed to learn and calibrate based on your expertise.
